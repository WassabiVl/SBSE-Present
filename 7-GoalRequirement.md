# Goal Requirement

1. Create score based assessment category of reproducibility and replication for the researches 
2. Choose 7-10 algorithms, that have FM data,  give them a Reproducibility/Replication Index
4. Run a  Control for Artefactual Results for the 7 algorithms as reproduction
4. Categories the replication process, 
   1. i.e. where does scalability fall into and what to take into consideration
   2. where does introduction of interactions to the data fall into
   3. where does the attributed real-world data fall into
5. alter the algorithm and run replication tests on them
