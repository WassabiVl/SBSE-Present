# Replication

## Biggest Downfall

::: notes

Researchers made many changes to the replication process/research that it was impossible to infer the consequences of their comparison, henceforth  they reported  an unsatisfactory aggregation results [12]

## Other Fields

Replication groups summary [12]

- little variation
- variation, but same method
- different methods

::: notes

1. Replications that vary little or not at all with respect to the reference experiment.
2. Replications that do vary but still follow the same method as the reference experiment.
3. Replications that use different methods to verify the reference experiment results.

## Internal Vs External [13]

**<u>External Quality Characteristics:</u>** Correctness, Usability, Efficiency, Reliability, Integrity, Adaptability, Accuracy, and Robustness.

**<u>Internal Quality Characteristics:</u>** Maintainability, Flexibility, Portability, Re-usability, Readability, Testability, and Understandability.

::: notes

 "*The **internal–external distinction** is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) into two parts: an internal part consisting of a linguistic framework  and observations related to that framework, and an external part  concerning practical questions about the utility of that framework.*" [6]

## Close Vs Differentiated [15]

- **<u>Exact replication</u>** 
- **<u>Close replication</u>** 
- **<u>Differentiated replication</u>** 

::: notes

**<u>Exact replication:</u>**  is where *Conceptual, Methodological, and Substantive* domains of research are held constant

- Repeat studies exactly reproduce the conditions of the original study in an attempt to see whether the empirical findings remain the same
- Repeat studies exactly reproduce the conditions of the original study in an attempt to see whether the empirical findings remain the same

**<u>Close replication:</u>** is where slight variation is permitted in *Conceptual, Methodological, or Substantive* domains of research
- Close replication is a category in which most aspects of a study are invariant 
- Use of a non-randomly selected holdout sample is a simple kind of close replication

**<u>Differentiated replication:</u>** is where the variation in *Conceptual, Methodological, and/or Substantive* domains of research is deliberate or purposeful
- Differentiated replication discovers whether an empirical finding generalizes—whether the finding is a candidate empirical generalizations

## Schemas [10]:

Almqvist defines the following four replication types:

1. Similar-external replications. 
2. Improved-internal replications. 
3. Similar-internal replications. 
4. Differentiated-external replications.
