# Replication

## Biggest Downfall

Researchers made many changes to the replication process/research that it was impossible to infer the consequences of their comparison, henceforth  they reported  an unsatisfactory aggregation results [11]

## Other Fields

Replication groups summary [11]

- Little variation
  - Replications that vary little or not at all with respect to the reference experiment.
- Variation, but same method
  - Replications that do vary but still follow the same method as the reference experiment.
- Different methods
  - Replications that use different methods to verify the reference experiment results.



## Internal Vs External [13]

**<u>External Quality Characteristics:</u>** Correctness, Usability, Efficiency, Reliability, Integrity, Adaptability, Accuracy, and Robustness.

**<u>Internal Quality Characteristics:</u>** Maintainability, Flexibility, Portability, Re-usability, Readability, Testability, and Understandability.



 "*The **internal–external distinction** is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) into two parts: an internal part consisting of a linguistic framework  and observations related to that framework, and an external part  concerning practical questions about the utility of that framework.*" [6] 



## Close Vs Differentiated [15]

**<u>Exact replication:</u>**  is where *Conceptual, Methodological, and Substantive* domains of research are held constant

- Repeat studies exactly reproduce the conditions of the original study in an attempt to see whether the empirical findings remain the same
- Repeat studies exactly reproduce the conditions of the original study in an attempt to see whether the empirical findings remain the same

**<u>Close replication:</u>** is where slight variation is permitted in *Conceptual, Methodological, or Substantive* domains of research
- Close replication is a category in which most aspects of a study are invariant 
- Use of a non-randomly selected holdout sample is a simple kind of close replication

**<u>Differentiated replication:</u>** is where the variation in *Conceptual, Methodological, and/or Substantive* domains of research is deliberate or purposeful
- Differentiated replication discovers whether an empirical finding generalizes—whether the finding is a candidate empirical generalizations

## Schemas (Almqvist [10]):

Almqvist defines the following four replication types:

1. Similar-external replications. 
2. Improved-internal replications. 
3. Similar-internal replications. 
4. Differentiated-external replications.
