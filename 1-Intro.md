Definition:

1. **SBSE** [1]
	
	- SBSE converts a software engineering problem into a computational search problem that can be tackled with a metaheuristic.
	- Some Examples are Tabu Search and Evolution Algorithms
	
2. **Metaheuristic** [2]
	- higher-level procedure or heuristic  designed to find, generate, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity
	
3. **Many-Objective Problems (MaOPs)** [4]
	- More challenging than MOP:
	  - Consist of more than three Objectives
	- <u>High computational cost</u> due to increased evaluation of number of points required for Pareto front approximation 
	- Inability of existing evolutionary multi-objective algorithms to solve many-objective optimization problems 
	- <u>Difficulty to visualize</u> the Pareto front with more than four objectives.
