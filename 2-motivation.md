# Motivation

## Why

- Recoginzed Problem
- Similar to SE problems
- Not scrutanized like developers
- Increased Validaton
- Simplify Scalability
- No real world Data

::: notes

- Reproducibility in computer science and other fields is a well-recognized problem.  
- SBSE Falls under the same issues faced by the software engineering problems of reproducing and replicating code and algorithms 
  - The Meta-Heuristic factor plays an important role in this matter
- Software engineering and computer scientists research does not fall under the same scrutiny of developers
  - Developers have to always check, refactor, and update their code on a continuous cycle
  - they have to work with ever changing team so interchangeability and exchange of codes has to smooth
  - create tests to validate the code
    - unit vs functional testing
  - Try not to reinvent the wheel
- As the number of  SBSE publications increase, so does the need to validation 
  - with the number of researches depending on previous work to progress SBSE forward
- Simplify Scalability in SBSE
- Real world software data is hard to come by
  - they are always increasing in complexity
  - but also the hardware is increasing in processing power

## Goal

- Test against real world valued attributed variability models
- Create an assessment tool to check the level of Reproducibility and Replication
- Help Future research create easier reproducible and replicable code and results
