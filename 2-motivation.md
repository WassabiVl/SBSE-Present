# Motivation

## Why

- Recognized Problem
	- Reproducibility in computer science and other fields is a well-recognized problem.  
- Similar to SE problems
	- SBSE Falls under the same issues faced by the software engineering problems of reproducing and replicating code and algorithms 
		- The Meta-Heuristic factor plays an important role in this matter
- Lacks Developer Scrutiny
	- Software engineering and computer scientists research does not fall under the same scrutiny of developers
		- Developers have to always check, refactor, and update their code on a continuous cycle
		- they have to work with ever changing team so interchangeability and exchange of codes has to smooth
		- creation of validation Tests ( Unit and functional Tests) to validate the individual parts of the code and the code as a whole
	- Try not to reinvent the wheel
	- use existing resources, libraries, algorithms
- Increased Validation
	- As the number of  SBSE publications increase, so does the need to validation 
		- with the number of researches depending on previous work to progress SBSE forward
- Real world software data is hard to come by
  - they are always increasing in complexity
  - but also the hardware is increasing in processing power 
  - no company wants to release their data or SPL to the public

## Goal

- Preproduce and replicate SBSE Experiments
- Simplify Scalability in SBSE, and testing against real-world attributed values
- Test against real world valued attributed variability models
- Create an assessment tool to check the level of Reproducibility and Replication
- Help Future research create easier reproducible and replicable code and results

# Focus

Feature Variability models as they provide the ability to replicate with real data
