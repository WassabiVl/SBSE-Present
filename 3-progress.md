## Others

### Version Control

GitHub Account has been set up to save the algorithms found and allow for a version control on the algorithms https://github.com/digital-bauhaus/reproducibility-of-SBSE

### SPLOT Website and LVAT

http://www.splot-research.org/
- A website designed to create and save features models used by researchers
- some features can range from 10 to 625 with ability to calculate valid configurations
- but attributes have to be augmented into the features
