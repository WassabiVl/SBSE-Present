## Data Types

Variability modeling (VM) falls under 2 categories (Czarnecki et al. [17])

1.  Feature modeling (FM)
2.  Decision modeling (DM)

::: notes

SPLOT Website and LVAT 

http://www.splot-research.org/
- A website designed to create and save features models used by researchers
- some features can range from 10 to 625 with ability to calculate valid configurations
- but attributes have to be augmented into the features
