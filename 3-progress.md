## Data Types

Variability modeling (VM) falls under 2 categories [17]

1.  Feature modeling (FM)
2.  Decision modeling (DM)

| Name                                 | # of Objective Function | Decision Variables | Constraints    | (VM) Types |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| DTLZ                                 | 2-20                    | 20-300             | 0 and more     | DM         |
| WFG                                  | 2-20                    | 20-300             | 0 and more     | DM         |
| Multi-objective 0/1 Knapsack Problem | 2-4                     | 100-750            | Knapsack Limit | DM         |
| LVAT                                 | Augmented               | 100-30,000         | 20 - unknown   | FM         |
| SPLOT                                | Augmented               | 5-627              | 0 - 4000       | FM         |



### SPLOT Website and LVAT 

http://www.splot-research.org/
- A website designed to create and save features models used by researchers
- some features can range from 10 to 625 with ability to calculate valid configurations
- but attributes have to be augmented into the features
